In Java, the main method must be static so the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) can call it directly without creating an object of the class. If main is not static, the program will not run, as the JVM wouldn't know how to execute it
Because the JVM always calls the main(String[] args) method as the entry point. The second main(String arr) method will not be called unless explicitly invoked.

The second main method (public static void main(String arr)) is not called automatically because the JVM only recognizes the main method with the exact signature:

public static void main(String[] args)

This specific signature is the entry point for Java programs. The second method does not match this signature and is treated like a regular method.

How to Call the Second main Method:

To call the second main method, you need to invoke it explicitly from the primary main method. Here's how:

public class ConstructorPractice {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("1111"); // Called automatically by the JVM
        main("example");           // Explicitly calling the second main method
    }

    public static void main(String arr) {
        System.out.println("2222");
    }
}

Output:

1111
2222

Explanation:

1. The JVM starts by calling main(String[] args) as the entry point.


2. Inside the primary main method, main("example") is explicitly called, which invokes the second main method.
