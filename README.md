Develop a React frontend for users to request reports with filters (e.g., date range).

Implement a .NET Core API to receive requests and enqueue them into Azure Service Bus.

Use background worker services to process queued requests asynchronously.

Generate reports and store them securely in Azure Blob Storage.

Maintain report metadata and status in Cosmos DB or SQL database.

Use SignalR to send real-time status updates (in-progress, completed, failed) to users.

Provide download links to generated reports through the frontend UI.
