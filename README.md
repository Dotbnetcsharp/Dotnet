We found a database issue in the stored procedure. The DocTypeDescription parameter is being passed as Daily Document, which works, but when we pass Daily_Document, it is not accepted. We informed Dharni, and he is checking with Jerry. The stored procedure should accept Daily_Document instead of Daily Document.
