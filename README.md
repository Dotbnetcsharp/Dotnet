Problem Statement: Queue-Based Report Monitoring with Real-Time Status (POC)

In the existing NTP application:

Users submit search requests (e.g., APN, Address, Owner, or Name) through an ASP.NET Core API.

These requests are sent to Azure Service Bus, where a Function App:

Picks them up,

Processes them,

Saves the results to Cosmos DB, and

Updates the status in a local database.



Each request flows through the states:

Scheduled âžœ In Progress âžœ Completed


---

ðŸŽ¯ Goal of the POC

To build a standalone monitoring tool using:

âœ… ASP.NET Core 8.0 API

âœ… Azure Service Bus SDK

âœ… Cosmos DB

âœ… SignalR for real-time updates

âœ… React for frontend dashboard



---

ðŸ§© What This Monitoring POC Will Do

1. Monitor all submitted search requests in real-time from Service Bus.


2. Show live request status updates (Scheduled, In Progress, Completed).


3. Allow users to filter/search requests by:

Search Type: APN, Address, Owner, Name

Date Range

Keywords (like APN number or Name)



4. For each Completed request:

Show result data pulled from Cosmos DB

Allow user to download report directly from UI.



5. Users can see all submitted requests across statuses in a single UI â€” like a live dashboard.


6. If a request is stuck or not processed, it will remain as In Progress or Scheduled, making debugging easier.






[HttpGet("status")]
public IActionResult GetReportsByDateRange([FromQuery] DateTime fromDate, [FromQuery] DateTime toDate)
{
    var results = ReportStore.Reports.Values
        .Where(r => r.FromDate >= fromDate && r.ToDate <= toDate)
        .ToList();

    return Ok(results);
}

  "fromDate": "2024-05-01T00:00:00",
